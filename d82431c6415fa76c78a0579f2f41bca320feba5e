      "message": "Although there\u0027s merit to doing it this way, with a constant at the beginning of the file, in this case I would prefer pass the list explicitly when calling the function, so it\u0027s easier to follow when reading the code, without having to jump up \u0026 down to see what\u0027s doing.\n\nWhen reading the code and seeing other of the surrounding variables like \"port\" or \"checksum\" or \"path\" in other parts of the file, one assumes that they contain a valid value and one generally doesn\u0027t care, unless worried by mismatches or the validity of the path.  But with \"ensure_installed_packages\" one immediately wonder if it\u0027s a few or hundreds, how long it will take, if there will be an error at that point in the case that the package cannot be retrieved/installed, etc.\n\nSo, in a word, is more complex and tricky than a typical global constant, and will often warrant an special inspection.\n\nBut it\u0027s not a strong feeling and I\u0027m happy to accept this change, so just mentioning the possibility in the case that it\u0027s shared, specially by Mykola as the author.",
