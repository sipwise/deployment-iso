      "message": "I haven\u0027t studied/understood all the changes, but if we can get rid of having the definitive network config at this stage it will be great.\n\nHowever, w.r.t. this change, I think that we should pile up packages to be installed and install them at once, or at least in bigger batches if possible, because installing them separately causes a very significant overhead.\n\nSo the function that I created should probably be changed to accept many packages at once, and then we can group them, for example moreutils+augeas-tools or also git if we detect the need for the section of puppet at the same time.\n\n(I\u0027m not suggesting that you also change the function installing packages, I can try this afternoon, but better if we do it soon.  You can submit this change as is if not ready, we can group the installation of packages later).",
