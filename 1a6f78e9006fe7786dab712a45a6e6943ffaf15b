      "message": "\u003e pls wrap variables with {}\n\nI left $TARGET like that on purpose because that\u0027s how the most of the rest of the file treats this variable in particular.\n\nAlso the message for die(), that I copy-pasted from above.\n\nDunno, I can rework it, but TBH I feel kind of lazy if I have to fix the original, cherry-pick -x, wait for all the approvals again and so on, when most of he file doesn\u0027t use {} for variables.  Especially this one, which is targetted, for mr6.4, which will be very short-lived.\n\nMaybe we should have another fix to convert the variables to {} in this file, or repo, at a single point?",
